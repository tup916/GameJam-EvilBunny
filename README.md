This is a project which I created in my first ever experience in a GameJam, with no prior experience in game making and Unity.
Overall, I am very happy with how it turned out, knowing the fact that I learned so much about the softwares which I used. 
I also learned to collaborate with other people who I have not worked with before.

# GameJam-EvilBunny
This game was created in 48 hours by a team of four students in GameJam hosted by University of Saskatchewan.
The software tools used for making this game were: Unity, Photoshop, and Windows Movie Maker.

Collaborators:
Tushita Patel - Third year Computer Science undregraduate student at University of Saskatchewan.
Parker Reese -  Third year Computer Science undregraduate student at University of Saskatchewan.
Nickolas Gough - Third year Computer Science undregraduate student at University of Saskatchewan.
Amy Kwan -  Second year Computer Science undregraduate student at University of Saskatchewan.

About the Game:
This goal of this game was for entertainment.
The bunny is a reference from a funny scene in the movie, Monty Python and the Holy Grail: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnOdAT6H94s
There are a total of four scenes, which get harder.


Game Scene:
The player is a rabbit in a dark cave with a flashlight. The flashlight allows him to only look at a limited radius around him. The rabbit must walk around the cave and try to kill as many knights as possible. The rabbit kills a knight by running into the knight.
As soon as the rabbit kills a knight, the five-second video from the actual scene in the movie plays and makes the player laugh.

Cool features:
The sound of the footsteps gets louder as the bunny approaches closer and closer to the knight. The sounds also guide the bunny to move around.
Because there is a timer on the top right corner of the screen, there is no end to the scene. The player has to spend the set amount of time trying to kill knights in the particular scene.
The timer freezes while the movie is played after the rabbit kills a knight.
